# Translation of proposed Navier-Stokes solution by Mukhtarbay Otelbaev

As detailed in [this Slashdot article](http://classic.slashdot.org/story/14/01/11/1715227), Dr. [Mukhtarbay Otelbaev](http://otelbaev.com/), a professor in the department of fundamental and applied mathematics of the L.N. Gumilyov Eurasian State University in Almaty, Kazakhstan, has published a paper with a proposed proof of the solvability of the Navier-Stokes equations.

This is a potentially important paper, because the question it addresses has been identified as a [Millennium Prize Problem](http://www.claymath.org/millenium-problems/navier%E2%80%93stokes-equation), one of the hardest and most valuable problems in the field of mathematics.

No confirmation of the validity of this solution has been given. The [paper describing the solution](http://www.math.kz/images/journal/2013-4/Otelbaev_N-S_21_12_2013.pdf) is freely available online. Unfortunately for English speakers, the paper is in Russian, apart from an incomplete and difficult-to-read summary on the last page.

This repo contains my ongoing attempt to translate the paper into English, using my knowledge of Russian and mathematics. Any and all contributions from others are welcome.

Current status: the abstract, introduction, and statement of the main result have been translated.
